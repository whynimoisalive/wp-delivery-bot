# LocalShop WhatsApp Bot

## Overview

LocalShop WhatsApp Bot is a hyper-local delivery solution that connects customers with nearby stores (within a 200-meter radius) through a WhatsApp-based ordering system. This project aims to streamline the ordering process for local general stores, allowing customers to browse products, place orders, and receive deliveries without the need for phone calls or in-person visits.

## Features

- WhatsApp-based ordering system
- Category and product navigation
- Automated bill generation
- Geofencing (200-meter radius limit)
- Order notifications for shops
- Basic analytics for store owners
